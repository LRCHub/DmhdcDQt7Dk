Young man with the bad thought
Doesn't go far, he just sits right here
My old man was a jackboy
With the black mask and I'm just like him
I don't like all the bright lights
When I ride by, I creep (so sick)
Got a blank face in my right hand
Like my dad's hand when I lose my shit
Say, "Freak"
The monster underneath your bed, nigga, that's me
The shadow on the other side of the room, don't blink
Big smile, big smile, nigga, don't play me
I'm the boogie-oogie man with the diamonds in my-
Big man with the big heart
Doesn't go far, he just flips that coin
Sit there with your suit and tie
Letting life be a bitch, I bet you're dead inside
Hit it right and flip a switch, I bet you crack a smile
You a big man in a sports car
You a big man, you got no heart
You a big man, you a monster
I can see you're dead inside
You open up, you're Frankenstein
Your screws are loose, your mouth is wired
Your skin is melting off
Monster in that room, better watch the suit
Better watch your step, bumping in the night
Monster in that room, I know who is who
I know I left you with the crooked eye
Monster in that room, better watch the suit
Better watch your step, bumping in the night
Monster in that room, I know who is who
I know I left you with the crooked eye
You a sick pup, you got shark teeth
You a pussy boy, nigga, not me
I should empty out your pockets, give me everything
You a businessman, I'm a stick up kid
I can see you're dead inside
You open up, you're Frankenstein
Your screws are loose, your mouth is wired
Skin is melting off
Monster in that room, better watch the suit
Better watch your step, bumping in the night
Monster in that room, I know who is who
I know I left you with the crooked eye
(I can see you're dead inside)
Better watch your step, bumping in the night
Monster in that room, I know who is who
I know I left you with the crooked eye
I can see you're dead inside
I can see you're dead inside
I can see you're dead inside
I can see you're dead inside
