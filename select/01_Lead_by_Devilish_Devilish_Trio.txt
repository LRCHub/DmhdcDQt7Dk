BAKER

Gimme sum sprinkle funk all in my b l u n t
Pull the smoke into my lungs as my hair blows in the breeze
Push me closer to the edge And watch me fall into the madness
So lost in The carnage taken pleasure in your sadness
It's that DT from the Tennessee Just a
Couple southern playas making music with a dream
Could give a fuck for what you want from us
We're doing as we please Kick back take
A listen and youll see just what we mean
Born a hellion your faith irrelevant there's no embellishment
Evil deeds done in the night these ghouls are lead by devilish
Click into to death mode my rage brings this mayhem
The scars on my backbone are from wings they've taken
Shunned by your master this creation a disaster
Make them pay for what they made and bring this hell unto the masses
See corrosion start to form inside the mind of the youth
Let my minions rein this terror show the weak that they are through
Thrust this blade into your temple Watch the memories
They flow Blood within this history for bakers legacy is cold
Murder through the centuries for years I've brought this trepidation
Now the time has finally come for me to rule this broken nation
Fuckem all I'm filled with hatred Lead them down into the spiral
Fill their minds with my pollution implement these thoughts of vile
Do not trust your fellow man for his kindness is illusion
Give into the wicked ways and bring this message of delusion

HYDRA

AS I WALK ALONG THE ROAD
OF CONSEQUENCE
INSIDE MY HEAD I START TO SLOWLY LOSE CONTROL
OF ALL MY THOUGHTS
I CANT REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED OFF IN THE WOODS LATE LAST NIGHT
I THINK I CHOKED A MOUTHY BITCH ALL JUST
FOR TALKIN TO ME LIKE SHE AINT SUPPOSED TO
ALL THIS BLOOD ALL ON MY CLOTHES IT MAKES IT OBVIOUS IT SEEMS THAT I
JUST FINALLY HAD ENOUGH OF WHAT THAT HOE WAS
SAYIN PLEASE DONT JUDGE ME FOR THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE
IVE BEEN PUSHED ACROSS THE EDGE
I PUT THE BLAME UPON THE REASONS OF MY SCHIZOPHRENIC FRIENDS

A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A WAY
TO CREEP AND CRAWL INSIDE YOUR SKIN
BUT THEY DONT THINK ABOUT THE MONSTER THAT RESEMBLES EVERY MAN
I KNOW YOU SAY THAT YOU AINT SCARED BUT THEN
REALITY IS HERE TO SLAP YOU RIGHT ACROSS THE FACE
WITHIN YOUR DREAMS THE BEAST APPEARS
YOU MOTHAFUCKAS THINK THE TRIO IS A GAME WELL COME APPROACH
I PROMISE MANE IT WILL NOT END THE WAY YOU WANTED SO TAKE CAUTION
IF YOU BUCK UP TO THE CLICK OF EVIL POSION WILL BE SPIT UPON ARRIVAL
ALL YOUR VITALS WILL BE STOPPED AND THEN
YOUR LEGS BECOME A PRESENT FOR THE DEVIL

ROLL A JUNT AND THEN I LIGHT IT
THIS HELPS WITH THE DISTANT MEMORIES OF
MURDER IT KEEPS THEM LOCKED UP AND FURTHER FAR FROM
PEOPLE I KNOW BUT
EVENTUALLY IT WILL COME UP ONTO THE
SURFACE TO HAUNT ME AND ONLY THEN ILL BE NOTICED
AND ITS A SHAME
I SWEAR I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THINGS WOULD
BE DIFFERENT BUT DEMONS FLOOD ME WITH HATRED
SO BOW AND PLEDGE AS MY WITNESS
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE GHOST
THATS BEEN HAUNTING YOU IN YOUR HOME
WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN FACED WITH TERROR
PRAY AND BEG I SUPPOSE
